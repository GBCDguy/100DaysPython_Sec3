Day 3: [Date]
Today's Progress:
I practiced control flow in Python by working on several Roller Coaster scenarios with different ticket pricing based on height and age. I also created a simple pizza ordering system, which calculates the total bill based on the pizza size and optional add-ons like pepperoni and cheese.

What I Learned:

Conditionals and Comparisons: Practiced using conditional statements (if, elif, else) and comparison operators (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=).
Nested Conditionals: Implemented nested if statements to apply different ticket prices based on age.
Input Handling: Used input() to capture user responses for height, age, and preferences like add-ons in the pizza ordering system.
Variable Incrementing: Learned how to update the bill variable dynamically based on choices made during the program, using the += operator.
Challenges:
Handling multiple conditions and ensuring proper user inputs were tricky at first, especially managing optional add-ons for pizza. But it was a good learning experience in structuring conditional logic.

Thoughts:
The pizza ordering program was fun to build and helped reinforce how to apply Python logic in real-world scenarios. Looking forward to exploring more complex programs!
